# Personal-Profile README

This website integrates Bootstrap and semantic html to deliver an online personal profile that is both web accessible and responsive. It includes a navbar, sticky footer, and responsive images. Using Bootstrap's grid system, there is little need to use media queries as the basic functionality is adaptable for various devices and screen sizes.
